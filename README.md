# Create a Review Analyzer with Watson Natural Language Understanding

![demo](https://i.makeagif.com/media/6-07-2018/IeEcIv.gif)

In this Code Pattern, we will create a Node.js app that takes the reviews from an online shopping website, Amazon, and feeds them into the Watson Natural Language Understanding service. The reviews will be stored in a Cloudant database. The Watson Natural Language Understanding service will show the overall sentiments of the reviews. The sample application will do all the reading of reviews for you and will give an overall insight about them. The Code Pattern can be useful to developers that are looking into processing multiple documents with Watson Natural Language Understanding.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Interact with Watson Natural Language Understanding using Watson's Node SDK
* Build a user interface around the result of Watson Natural Language Understanding
* Create and use Cloudant NoSQL Database
* Deploy a Nodejs application to analyze product reviews

## Flow
1. The user deploys the app in IBM Cloud. The user interacts with the user interface of the app.
2. The user enters the product URL and the app would start getting the reviews of the Product.
3. The app then stores the reviews in a database for later use.
4. The app starts to upload the reviews in Watson Natural Language Understanding.
5. After Watson Natural Language Understanding finishes processing the reviews, the app then stores the result (General Sentiment and Top Entities) in Cloudant. The user will see the result in the UI.

## Included components
* [Watson Natural Language Understanding](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/natural-language-understanding/):  Analyze text to extract meta-data from content such as overall sentiment, emotion, concepts, entities, keywords, categories, relations and semantic roles.
* [Cloudant NoSQL DB](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db): A fully managed data layer designed for modern web and mobile applications that leverages a flexible JSON schema.

## Featured technologies
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): An open-source JavaScript run-time environment for executing server-side JavaScript code.
* [Databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Information_Management_System#.22Full_Function.22_databases): Repository for storing and managing collections of data.
* [Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/learn/cloud/): Accessing computer and information technology resources through the Internet.

# Steps

Use the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button **OR** create the services and run locally.

## Deploy to IBM Cloud
If you do not have an IBM Cloud account yet, you will need to create one [here](https://ibm.biz/BdjLxy).

[![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/watson-second-opinion)

1. Press the above `Deploy to IBM Cloud`
    > The toolchain uses GitHub for its source control. You may be asked to authenticate the toolchain to use your account. The toolchain will clone this repo and will be used for its deployment.
<!--optional step-->
2. In Toolchains, click on ``Delivery Pipeline`` to watch while the app is deployed. Once deployed, the app can be viewed by clicking ``View app``.

<!--update with service names from manifest.yml-->
3. To see the app and services created and configured for this Code Pattern, use the IBM Cloud dashboard. The app will be named according to what you inputted in the toolchain. The following services are created and easily identified by the `wso-` prefix:
    * wso-nlu
    * wso-cloudant

### Update the Environment of your deployed app

![envVar1](https://i.makeagif.com/media/6-07-2018/Gfmeju.gif)

1. Navigate to https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps/
2. Located and click on your newly created application 
3. Select 'Runtime' in the left menu
4. Select the 'Environment Variables' tab in the middle of the page
5. Scroll down to the User defined variables section
6. Click on ``add``. 
7. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Make sure to write the name of the env variable EXACTLY as shown, otherwise, the app wont work. Scroll up until you see `VCAP_SERVICES`. You will then see `cloudantNoSQLDB` and under that `url`.  Under 'Name', type in `CLOUDANT_URL`, and under 'Value', paste the `url` value from the `cloudantNoSQLDB` section of `VCAP_SERVICES`.

![envVar2](https://i.makeagif.com/media/6-07-2018/ubRZcv.gif)

8. Repeat step 6 but now under name, type in `NLU_USERNAME` and under value go to `natural-language-understanding` section of the `VCAP_SERVICES` and get the value for `username`.
9. Repeat step 6 but now under name, type in `NLU_PASSWORD`, and under value go `natural-language-understanding` section of the `VCAP_SERVICES` and get the value for `password`.
10. Click ``save``.
11. Nice job! You are done. Click on ``visit App URL`` at the top of the page to interact with the app. Simply copy and paste an Amazon URL from a product page into the app, and click on the magnifying glass and voilÃ ! You will get some valuable insights from Watson.

## Deploy Locally

### 1. Clone the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/watson-second-opinion
$ cd watson-second-opinion/
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

### 3. Create IBM Cloud services

Create the following service:

* [**Watson Natural Language Understanding**](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding)
* [**Cloudant NoSQL DB**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/)

### 4. Get Service Credentials


### 5. Set Envioronment Variables

### 6. Run the App


![Landing Page](docs/analysis.png)

Find a product in Amazon that you want to learn more about, copy the URL of the product page, paste it into the app, and click ðŸ”Ž.

After Watson Natural Language Understanding finishes processing all the reviews, the app should show you its General Sentiment and Top entities found.

# Privacy Notice

Sample Kubernetes Yaml file that includes this package may be configured to track deployments to [IBM Cloud](https://www.bluemix.net/) and other Kubernetes platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/IBM/metrics-collector-service) service on each deployment:

* Kubernetes Cluster Provider(`IBM Cloud, Minikube, etc`)
* Kubernetes Cluster ID (Only from IBM Cloud's cluster)

This data is collected from the Kubernetes Job in the sample application's yaml file. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Cloud to measure the usefulness of our examples so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

## Disabling Deployment Tracking

Please comment out/remove the Metric Kubernetes Job portion in the `watson-review-analyzer.yaml` file.
